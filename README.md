# Tailwind CSS Flexbox Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS with flexbox layouts.  Two divs, each intended to occupy half the width, unexpectedly overlap or have incorrect sizing.

## Bug
The `bug.html` file shows the problematic code.  The expected behavior is two equally sized divs, one red and one blue, side-by-side, filling the container. However, due to the issue, this doesn't occur correctly.

## Solution
The `solution.html` file provides a fix for this problem.  This showcases common solutions for resolving layout inconsistencies when working with Tailwind and flexbox.
